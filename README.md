# Another Machine Learning Learning Project

Same as [Pixel Food Classificator](https://github.com/flerokoo/pixel-food-classificator), but, unlike it, was done with Keras module of Tensorflow.

## Model structure

* Two convolutional layers with 3x3 kernel and 64 filters and ReLU activation function
* Dense layer with 64 neurons and ReLU 
* Dense layer with 3 neurons and softmax activation

## Output

Here's some plots from Tensorboard
